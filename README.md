# hyperion-react-I

## Background

This is my first React.js project done while doing the immersive full stack and software engineering bootcamp at HyperionDev.

## Nature of project

The project takes a JavaScript object called user of a fictional user of the App. The properties of the object is:

- name
- surname
- date_of_birth
- address
- country
- email
- telephone
- company
- profile_picture
- shopping_cart (array of items)

The App then displays all the information of the user in an attractive way.

## Conclusion

This was a very simple project just to explore the very basics of React.js.
